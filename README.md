# Express Library

README files are usually written in the MARKDOWN format
(.md is short for markdown).

## File Structure

- bin/ = files you run directly in the terminal
  - www = file we need to run to start our app (it displays the error pages)
- models/ = Mongoose model files
- public/ = Static files (just like before)
  - images/ = image files
  - javascripts/ = for FRONT END js
  - stylesheets/ = for CSS
    - style.scss = ONLY EDIT THIS FILE (it's a SASS file)
- routes/ = where all the routes will be defined in multiple router files
  - index.js = contains home page route and all the information page routes
- views/ = HBS files (just like before)

  - index.hbs = home page
  - layout.hbs = layout file
  - not-found.hbs = 404 page
  - error.hbs = generic error page (not 404 errors)

- .env = file for ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (more on this later)
  - PORT = change the server's port number here
- .gitignore = list of files/folders to NOT push to GitHub
- app.js = connecting all the pieces of the app together
- package-lock.json = specific versions of all our npm packages
  (so everyone has the same version)
- package.json = list of all our npm packages AND our scripts
  - use "npm run-script dev" to run the app
- README.md = documentation of this project!
